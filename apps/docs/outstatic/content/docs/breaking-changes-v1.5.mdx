We've added a few components which are styled using a `outstatic` css namespace (id).

To make sure your dashboard works with the new styles, you should add the id to your `app/(cms)/layout.tsx`'s `body` tag.

`/app/(cms)/layout.tsx`

```javascript
export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body id="outstatic">{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
```
